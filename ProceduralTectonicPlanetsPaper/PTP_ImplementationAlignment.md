# Procedural Tectonic Planets – Implementation Alignment

This document maps each section of the paper to the current PlanetaryCreation implementation (Milestones 0–4 in progress, future work outlined). Each subsection lists key paper claims/features, our current status, gaps, and planned follow-up. Alignment indicators use:

- ✅ Aligned (implemented and validated)
- ⚠️ Partially aligned (core feature present, polish or scope gap remains)
- ❌ Not aligned (feature missing or divergent)

---

## Abstract & Introduction
**Paper**
- Interactive procedural model for tectonic planets, multi-phenomena (subduction, collision, oceanic crust, rifts).
- Supports user-triggered events, global + local control, high-resolution amplification.

**Implementation**
- ✅ Milestones 0–4 deliver interactive authoring in editor, deterministic simulation with subduction, collision, oceanic crust, rifts, hotspots, splits/merges, thermal coupling.
- ✅ UI toggles for re-tessellation, plate splits, thermal/retess switches available in `SPTectonicToolPanel`.
- ⚠️ High-resolution amplification beyond stress-displacement (procedural/exemplar detail) scheduled for Milestone 6.

**Alignment:** ⚠️ (core authoring delivered; fine-detail amplification pending).

## 2. Related Work
Informational section; no direct implementation requirement.

**Implementation**
- ✅ Planning documents reference prior art, track deviations.

**Alignment:** ✅

---

## 3. Overview (Workflow & Model)
**Paper**
- Plates initialized as Voronoi cells; Lloyd relaxation for even centroids.
- “More irregular continent shapes can be obtained by warping the geodesic distances to the centroids using a simple noise function.”
- Simulation loop handles tectonic events and amplification; user-triggered events supported.

**Implementation**
- ✅ `GenerateIcospherePlates()` + `ApplyLloydRelaxation()` mirror the base initialization.
- ✅ Noise-warped Voronoi assignment implemented in Milestone 4 Phase 5 (`VoronoiWarpingTest` proves determinism + parameter control).
- ✅ `AdvanceSteps()` processes tectonic events with user switches.
- ⚠️ Amplification stage (procedural/exemplar detail) not yet implemented (Milestone 6).

**Alignment:** ⚠️ (core workflow + noise warping delivered; Stage B amplification pending).

## 4. Procedural Tectonics
### 4.1 Subduction
**Paper**
- Uplift from relative speed, distance to front, elevation; slab pull updates rotation axis; terrane handling.

**Implementation**
- ⚠️ Boundary classification, stress accumulation, deterministic split/merge operate as intended; uplift magnitudes approximate the paper's f(d)/g(ν)/h(z) curves via Gaussian falloff + stress scaling rather than explicit parametric functions.
- Slab pull and fold direction heuristics simplified; flagged for tuning in a future milestone.

**Alignment:** ⚠️ (functional but heuristic vs the paper's explicit uplift curves).

### 4.2 Continental Collision
**Paper**
- Suture terranes, localized uplift area depends on area/speed, discrete elevation surge; terrane extraction and reattachment handled explicitly.

**Implementation**
- ❌ Terrane extraction/reattachment not implemented; merges collapse entire plate without isolating terranes.
- ⚠️ Deterministic merge blends angular velocity/centroids, but uplift amplification left to Milestone 6; collision surge currently reflected as stress + displacement only.
- 📌 Action: Schedule terrane handling in Milestone 6 (Surface Evolution) with erosion/amplification.

**Alignment:** ❌ (core collision works, but terrane behaviour missing).

### 4.3 Oceanic Crust Generation
**Paper**
- Generate new points at ridge, assign to plates, compute crust parameters (age, ridge direction); elevation template zᵀ for amplification.

- **Implementation**
- ✅ Retess + Voronoi rebuild add nodes near ridges; crust parameters (age, ridge direction) tracked via vertex velocities.
- Stage-B template profile for amplification deferred to Milestone 6 (documented).
- ✅ Thermal field now decouples hotspot temperature from mechanical stress (ApplyHotspotThermalContribution updated in M4 Phase 5); stress remains driven by plate interactions as in the paper.

**Alignment:** ✅ (core crust generation and thermal handling in place; amplification layer pending).

### 4.4 Plate Rifting
**Paper**
- Poisson-triggered rifts, Voronoi fracture lines, new sub-plates diverge.

**Implementation**
- ✅ Deterministic split algorithm uses boundary data; Poisson-like triggers via thresholds; logs width/age and triggers retess.

**Alignment:** ✅

### 4.5 Continental Erosion & Oceanic Dampening
**Paper**
- Simple erosion/dampening formulas applied each step (sufficient at 50 km coarse resolution); sediment filling in trenches.

**Implementation**
- ⚠️ Divergent dampening implemented via stress decay (Milestone 3 stress model); continental erosion and sediment filling not yet coded.
- Logged as future enhancement (Milestone 6) with TODOs in design doc.

**Alignment:** ⚠️ (partial coverage; erosion/sediment pass outstanding).

---

## 5. Amplification
**Paper** – two-stage process:
1. **Stage A:** amplify coarse crust to higher mesh density (adaptive meshing/LOD).  
2. **Stage B:** apply procedural noise & exemplar blending for ~100 m relief.

**Implementation**
- ⚠️ Stage A LOD system implemented in Phase 4 (distance-based L4/L5/L7 tiers with hysteresis, caching, async pre-warm); Level 7 profiling/export still pending to match paper’s 500 k sample data.
- ❌ Stage B (procedural/exemplar detail) scoped for Milestone 6; not started.

**Alignment:** ⚠️ (Stage A functional but awaiting parity metrics; Stage B still upcoming).

---

## 6. Implementation Details
**Paper**
- Fibonacci sampling, spherical Delaunay, periodic resampling, collision acceleration structures.

**Implementation**
- ✅ Base samples + Lloyd; resampling via deterministic full rebuild (design addendum records justification: simpler, 0.1–18 ms cost).
- ✅ Collision checks handled via boundary adjacency; performance acceptable per profiling.

**Alignment:** ✅ (approach differs but documented and performant).

---

## 7. Results & Validation
### 7.1 Rendering & Performance (Paper Section 7)
**Paper**
- Adaptive meshing scheme; frame rate 37–145 FPS depending on altitude; 500 k point samples (≈ L7/L8). Paper references [CR11] for planet-scale rendering guidance; the reference isn’t available to us, so our LOD plan extrapolates from the paper summary.

**Implementation**
- ✅ Phase 4 controller implements distance-based LOD (L4/L5/L7) with hysteresis, caching, and async pre-warm.
- ⚠️ Current profiling covers L0–L6 (up to 81 k tris) with <120 ms step target met through L5; Level 7 (≈327 k tris) profiling pending.
- ⚠️ Haven’t replicated 500 k-vertex performance table; scheduled once Level 7 automation stabilizes.

**Alignment:** ⚠️ (system in place; parity metrics still outstanding).

### 7.2 Control & Comparison
**Paper**
- User can interactively control plate motions, rifting scenarios, etc.; comparison to noise-based planets.

**Implementation**
- ✅ UI panel provides seed/toggles, step/regenerate, overlays; deterministic splits allow scenario scripting.
- ✅ Visual comparison gallery captured (Phase 5 Task 5.2) with parity notes logged in `Docs/ReleaseNotes_M4.md`.

**Alignment:** ✅

### 7.3 Validation
**Paper**
- User study with forced-choice comparison vs fractal model.

**Implementation**
- ⚠️ Automation tests cover deterministic outputs; user study not replicated (outside project scope). Plan to capture visual gallery for internal review.

**Alignment:** ⚠️

### 7.4 Performance Table (Table 2)
**Paper**
- Reports per-step timing for subduction, collision, elevation, total/pipeline at multiple resolutions.

- **Implementation**
- ⚠️ Current instrumentation logs retess (0.10 ms L0 → 18.4 ms L6, 228 ms outlier @ L6) and aggregate step time (~101 ms at Level 3 with 20 plates); subduction/collision/elevation currently share the same timer inside `AdvanceSteps`.
- ⚠️ Partial breakdown available: re-tessellation 1.8 ms (Level 3) / 18.4 ms (Level 6); stress interpolation <1 ms; remaining tectonic step (subduction+collision+rift checks) ~99 ms.
- 📌 Action: add scoped timers post-LOD to match paper columns and capture Level 7 parity after SIMD/GPU optimisation (Milestone 6).

**Alignment:** ⚠️ (partial metrics collected; full table scheduled after Phase 4 profiling).

### 7.5 Limitations & Future Work
**Paper** identifies future improvements (better rifting tearing, passive margins, hot spots, climate coupling).

**Implementation**
- ✅ Hotspots/rifts implemented (Milestone 4 Phase 2).
- ⚠️ Passive margins, advanced tearing algorithms, climate coupling deferred to Milestones 6–8.

**Alignment:** ⚠️ (acknowledged; tracked for future work).

## 8. Conclusion
Paper’s closing statements match project goals; no additional requirements.

**Alignment:** ✅

---

## 9. Determinism & Reproducibility (Implementation Enhancement)
**Paper** assumes consistent behavior but doesn’t discuss determinism explicitly.

**Implementation**
- ✅ Seeded `FRandomStream` ensures repeatable plate initialization, hotspot placement, rift events.
- ✅ Deterministic split/merge derive Euler poles from geometry (no RNG).
- ✅ Full rebuild re-tessellation avoids incremental drift.
- ✅ Automation tests (`PlateSplitMergeTest`, `DeterministicTopologyTest`) confirm identical plate states across runs.

**Alignment:** ✅ (we exceed paper by guaranteeing determinism).
