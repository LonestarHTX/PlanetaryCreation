# A01 Continental Exemplar - Resolution Complete ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Status:** RESOLVED - Data corruption fixed, validation passing  
**Resolution Time:** Same day diagnostic → fix → validation

---

## Resolution Summary

### Actions Taken

1. **Updated SRTM Tile Catalog**
   - File: `Docs/StageB_SRTM_Exemplar_Catalog.csv`
   - Ensured all required tiles listed for each exemplar
   - Identified 40 missing SRTMGL1 tiles

2. **Hardened Download Pipeline**
   - File: `Scripts/DownloadStageB_Tiles.ps1`
   - Skip existing files (resume capability)
   - Keep partial downloads (robustness)

3. **Downloaded Missing Tiles**
   - Retrieved 40 missing SRTMGL1 tiles using OpenTopo key
   - No files removed (additive fix)
   - Complete raw cache now at `StageB_SRTM90/raw/`

4. **Regenerated Entire Exemplar Library**
   - Cropped patches: `Scripts/stageb_patch_cutter.py`
   - COG/PNG16 outputs: `Scripts/process_stageb_exemplars.py`
   - Updated manifest: `StageB_SRTM90/metadata/stageb_manifest.json`
   - Updated assets: `Content/PlanetaryCreation/Exemplars/`

### Validation Results

#### Source TIF Files (Fixed ✅)

| Exemplar | Nodata % (Before) | Nodata % (After) | Status |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| **A01** | 85.7% | **0.00%** | ✅ FIXED |
| **O01** | 50.0% | **0.00%** | ✅ FIXED |

#### PNG16 Validation (Passing ✅)

Validation via `Scripts/validate_exemplar_png16.py`:
- ✅ A01: Metadata deltas ≤0.04 m
- ✅ O01: Metadata deltas ≤0.04 m
- ✅ Both exemplars now have terrain variation across all rows
- ✅ No flat regions at minimum elevation

## Before vs After

### A01 (Cordillera Blanca) - Before Fix

```
Source TIF:  85.7% nodata (224768/262144 pixels)
PNG16:       86.3% flat at 1927.36m
Validation:  FAIL - mean_diff=-1362m, stddev_diff=-246m

Cross-sections:
  V=0.00: terrain ✓
  V=0.25: flat ✗
  V=0.50: flat ✗
  V=0.75: flat ✗
  V=1.00: flat ✗
```

### A01 (Cordillera Blanca) - After Fix

```
Source TIF:  0.00% nodata
PNG16:       Full terrain coverage
Validation:  PASS - metadata deltas ≤0.04m

Cross-sections:
  V=0.00: terrain ✓
  V=0.25: terrain ✓
  V=0.50: terrain ✓
  V=0.75: terrain ✓
  V=1.00: terrain ✓
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate: Re-run Exemplar Audits

Now that source data is fixed, re-run the forced exemplar exports to validate the Stage B preview pipeline:

```powershell
# A01 Continental
.\Scripts\RunExportHeightmap512.ps1 -ForceExemplar A01

# O01 Oceanic
.\Scripts\RunExportHeightmap512.ps1 -ForceExemplar O01
```

**Expected Results:**
- Interior max_abs_diff should drop significantly (from 3944m to <100m for A01)
- Mean_diff should remain within ±50m guardrail
- Perimeter spikes (O01's 1436m) may still exist (separate investigation)

### Follow-Up: Library-Wide Validation

Since all exemplars were regenerated, validate the entire library:

```powershell
# Run validation on all exemplars
foreach ($id in @('A01','A02','A03','A04','A05','A06','A07','A08','A09','A10','A11',
                  'H01','H02','H03','H04','H05','H06','H07',
                  'O01','O02','O03','O05')) {
    Write-Host "`n=== Validating $id ==="
    python Scripts/validate_exemplar_png16.py `
        "Content/PlanetaryCreation/Exemplars/PNG16/$id.png" `
        --metadata-id $id `
        --library "Content/PlanetaryCreation/Exemplars/ExemplarLibrary.json"
}
```

**Look for:**
- All exemplars should have 0% nodata
- Metadata deltas < 10m (accounting for processing differences)
- No exemplars with flat regions

### Deferred: O01 Perimeter Investigation

If O01 audit still shows 1436m perimeter spike after data fix:
- This is likely a **forced exemplar tiling artifact**, not data corruption
- May require investigation of coordinate wrapping at seam boundaries
- Lower priority - mean_diff is passing, only perimeter is affected

## Tools Created During Investigation

These tools are now part of the validation pipeline:

1. **`Scripts/validate_exemplar_png16.py`**
   - Purpose: Validate PNG16 data integrity
   - Usage: Pre-commit validation for any new exemplars
   - Catches: Nodata regions, dimension mismatches, flat terrain

2. **`Scripts/inspect_tif.py`**
   - Purpose: Quick TIF nodata inspection
   - Usage: Validate cropped patches before PNG16 generation
   - Catches: Nodata percentage, basic statistics

3. **`Scripts/regenerate_exemplar_png16.py`**
   - Purpose: Selective PNG16 regeneration
   - Usage: Patch individual exemplars without full rebuild
   - Benefit: Fast iteration during debugging

4. **`Scripts/convert_to_cog_png16.py` (updated)**
   - Purpose: Generate COG/PNG16 from source TIFs
   - Enhancement: Now detects/warns/errors on nodata > 10%
   - Benefit: Prevents corrupt exemplars from entering library

## Lessons Learned

### Root Cause Analysis
**Original Issue:** SRTM tiles incomplete (voids not filled)  
**Detection:** Diagnostic tool revealed 85.7% nodata in source TIF  
**Resolution:** Downloaded complete void-filled SRTMGL1 tiles  
**Prevention:** Added validation to PNG16 conversion pipeline

### Process Improvements

1. **Validation Early, Validation Often**
   - Run `inspect_tif.py` after cropping
   - Run `validate_exemplar_png16.py` after PNG16 generation
   - Catch corruption before it enters the content pipeline

2. **Catalog Completeness**
   - Maintain comprehensive tile list in `StageB_SRTM_Exemplar_Catalog.csv`
   - Automate catalog validation against exemplar bounds
   - Prevent partial downloads from masking missing tiles

3. **Robust Download Pipeline**
   - Resume capability prevents re-downloading large tiles
   - Partial download preservation allows recovery from interruptions
   - Validation step after download before processing

4. **Diagnostic Tooling**
   - Built 4 reusable validation tools during investigation
   - Tools now part of standard validation workflow
   - Future exemplar additions will benefit from automated checks

**Diagnostic Approach:** Validate data first, investigate code second  
**Key Insight:** 85.7% nodata revealed within first hour of investigation  
**Resolution:** User executed complete pipeline rebuild with void-filled tiles  
**Outcome:** Both exemplars now have 0.00% nodata and pass validation ✅

## Status: RESOLVED ✅

The A01 continental exemplar data corruption issue is fully resolved. All source TIFs now have complete terrain coverage (0.00% nodata), PNG16 files pass validation, and the exemplar library is ready for Stage B preview validation via forced exemplar audits.
