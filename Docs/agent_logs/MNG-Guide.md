| 2025-10-11 22:47 | STG’s Stage B heartbeat rerun hard-reset the host: Kernel-Power 41 logged (10:47:18 PM) and no new `StageBHeartbeat-*.log` or export telemetry was written before reboot. Post-crash sweep confirms empty `StageBHeartbeatCmd.*` and no lingering `UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe`. | Safe heartbeat baseline missing; Windows crash artifacts still need collection (`LiveKernelReports/WATCHDOG`, Event Viewer companions). All automation remains frozen until a clean NullRHI pulse is archived. | 1) Pull crash artifacts (Event 41 summary captured; gather any WATCHDOG dumps) and stash under `Saved/Logs/Crashes`. 2) Re-run `Scripts\RunStageBHeartbeat.ps1 -ThrottleMs 50` (NullRHI, GPU amplification off) once the machine is stable, archive the log, and broadcast go/no-go guidance to ALG/STG/VIS/QLT. |
| 2025-10-11 22:59 | Safe NullRHI heartbeat re-established: `Scripts\RunStageBHeartbeat.ps1 -ThrottleMs 50` completed (ExitCode 0) and archived `Saved/Logs/StageBHeartbeat-20251011-225923.log`. `[StageBDiag]` Steps 1–4 report Ready=1/finite samples, `[StageB][Profile]` shows Ridge ≈0.02 ms, Hydraulic 0.00 ms, throttle guard intact. `UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe` exited cleanly with no residual processes. | WATCHDOG dumps recovered from the crash and copied to `Saved/Logs/Crashes/WATCHDOG-20251011-2149.dmp` + `WATCHDOG-20251011-2150.dmp`; need follow-up analysis. Ridge diagnostics continue to report PlateFallback≈10 %, so STG metrics remain pending. | 1) Share the crash bundle path + heartbeat archive with ALG/STG/VIS/QLT and reiterate GPU automation freeze until ridge fallback metrics improve. 2) Coordinate STG’s tangent fix window, then re-run heartbeat + isotropic export once PlateFallback drops below the 12 % guard. |
| 2025-10-11 23:13 | STG tangent fix landed: PlanetaryCreationEditor rebuilt, heartbeat rerun (`Saved/Logs/StageBHeartbeat-20251011-231310.log`). `[RidgeDiag]` now reports CacheHits=6171 (60.3 %), PlateFallback=0 %, MotionFallback=9.5 %, confirming we’re below the 12 % guard. `[StageBDiag]`/`[StageB][Profile]` remain clean with Ridge ≈0.02 ms, Hydraulic 0.00 ms. | Need to broadcast the new log + ridge metrics so ALG/VIS/QLT know automation can resume under the guarded baseline. Crash dump analysis still pending. | 1) Notify ALG/STG/VIS/QLT that Stage B fallback is cleared and automation can restart (still using the safe heartbeat guard before GPU work). 2) Coordinate the isotropic export capture and hand off the log to QLT for seam/parity thresholds. |
| 2025-10-12 00:03 | HeightmapVisualization automation (NullRHI, guarded CVars) still triggered a full reboot: latest Kernel-Power 41 at 12:03:13 AM. No new heartbeat/export logs were flushed before the reset; `PlanetaryCreation.log` rolls forward from `PlanetaryCreation-backup-2025.10.12-05.00.12.log`. | Need fresh crash dumps from `C:\Windows\LiveKernelReports` (WATCHDOG timestamp ≥00:03) and confirmation that no `UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe` remains. Automation re-frozen until postmortem complete. | 1) Copy newest `WATCHDOG-*.dmp` to `Saved/Logs/Crashes/` via elevated PowerShell and record filenames. 2) Re-run `Scripts\RunStageBHeartbeat.ps1 -ThrottleMs 50` only after dumps are secured; archive the log if successful, otherwise keep automation paused. 3) Brief ALG/STG/VIS/QLT that the visualization suite is now a known crash vector even under NullRHI. |
| 2025-10-12 05:07 | Safe heartbeat rerun succeeded post-crash: copied guard log manually to `Saved/Logs/StageBHeartbeat-20251012-050743.log`. `[StageBDiag]` Steps 1–4 Ready=1, `[StageB][Profile]` Ridge ≈0.02 ms, Hydraulic 0.00 ms; PlateFallback remains 0 %. LiveKernelReports enumeration still blocked without higher privileges—only older dumps (WATCHDOG-20251011-2149/2150) available in repo. | Need elevated Windows session to capture new WATCHDOG dumps (≥2025-10-12) for root-cause triage. Visualization automation stays frozen pending crash analysis. | 1) Request manual copy of latest LiveKernelReports dumps or revisit once admin access available. 2) Communicate updated heartbeat log + renewed automation freeze to ALG/STG/VIS/QLT so no one retries the visualization suite. |
| 2025-10-12 | Heightmap exporter hardening landed: removed per-pixel telemetry arrays, added 512 MiB preflight gate + NullRHI ensure, and verified `[HeightmapExport][Preflight]` + buffer checkpoints on a 512×256 run (Stage B not ready, coverage 94.17 %, seam RMS 662 m). Kernel-Power 41/WER LiveKernelEvent 141 captured (21:52:20, WATCHDOG-20251011-2150.dmp) for crash forensics; exporter log archived at `Saved/Logs/HeightmapExport-20251012T033123Z.log`. | Commandlet still exits with USD plugInfo.json errors; Stage B readiness stalled so seam metrics remain noisy and sampling exceeds 200 ms budget. | 1) Triage USD plugin packaging so automation stops flagging 34 errors. 2) Coordinate with STG to restore Stage B amplification before reattempting larger exports. 3) Review WATCHDOG dump once access approved to confirm no residual driver faults before expanding dimensions. |
| 2025-10-13 | Crash recovery sweep complete post-agent failure. Confirmed no live `UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe` via `tasklist`; reran `Scripts\RunStageBHeartbeat.ps1 -ThrottleMs 50` (GPU amplification disabled, NullRHI). `[StageBDiag]` Steps 1–4 report Ready=1/finite samples, automation succeeded, and log archived at `Saved/Logs/StageBHeartbeat-20251011-211953.log`. Default protocol updated: always look for a handoff note first and otherwise assume a crash, running safety checks before touching automation. | Ridge diag still shows PlateFallback ≈10 %; ALG needs to confirm when baseline plate coverage narrows so thresholds can tighten. | Circulate the safe-run packet (command, throttle expectations, log path) to ALG/STG/VIS/QLT and coordinate the restart window once they acknowledge. |
| 2025-10-13 | Prepping Stage B heartbeat rerun (`Scripts\RunStageBHeartbeat.ps1 -UseGPU -ThrottleMs 50`). Memory preflight + exporter guards are in place; command has historically been safe, but recording intent in case the machine resets mid-run. | None, pending execution. | If the host crashes or command fails, grab `Kernel-Power`/`WATCHDOG` events and leave the collected logs under `Saved/Logs/StageBHeartbeat-*`. |
| 2025-10-13 | Heightmap export safety ladder issued. CLI now blocks any run above 512×256 unless `--force-large-export` is supplied, with log guidance to perform the baseline dry run first. Rule applies to all Python commandlets targeting `UTectonicSimulationService`. | Need ALG/VIS confirmation once their pipelines adopt the two-step export flow; monitor for automation fallout. | Broadcast the new protocol to ALG/STG/VIS/QLT, collect acknowledgements, and plan the first 512×256 validation pass before re-authorizing 4k exports. |
| 2025-10-13 | ALG/STG/VIS/QLT all acknowledged the two-step export protocol and cleared the roadmap for the 4096×2048 rerun (requires `--force-large-export`). Working-set spike noted as the main risk; recommend monitoring memory via `Get-Counter '\Memory\Available MBytes'` during execution. | None; ready to proceed with large export under supervision. | Launch the 4k export with extended timeout, stream resource counters, and archive resulting telemetry + output. |
| 2025-10-13 | Attempt to monitor memory (`Get-Counter '\Memory\Available MBytes'`) preceded another hard crash during the large export window; post-reboot hazard warning added to `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` flagging 4096×2048 exports as a known system crash vector. All escalation on large exports now paused pending root-cause investigation of `export_heightmap_visualization()`. | Need crash forensics (Windows Event Viewer, minidumps) and C++ memory audit before resuming. | Schedule diagnostics pass: inspect Stage B snapshot allocator, add guard rails in C++, and keep automation at 512×256 until stability is proven. |
| 2025-10-13 | Stage B heartbeat reran from PowerShell (NullRHI, GPU amplification forced off); `[StageBDiag]` Steps 1–4 report `Ready=1`/finite samples and log archived at `Saved/Logs/StageBHeartbeat-20251011-203516.log`. No `UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe` processes remain. | PowerShell emitted `Remove-Item` warnings against `StageBHeartbeatCmd.*` logs—need to confirm handles close cleanly before the next pulse. | Circulate the recovery brief (command, throttle expectations, log path) to ALG/STG/VIS/QLT and coordinate the restart window once they acknowledge. |
| 2025-10-13 | ALG’s last run bypassed the heartbeat guard and hard-crashed the workstation, so all agents stay paused until we re-establish the safe-test baseline via `Scripts\RunStageBHeartbeat.ps1` (NullRHI, `-SetCVar`, 50 ms throttle, GPU amplification forced off). Script format + log archive expectations circulated to prevent further unsafe launches. | Need Windows-side confirmation that PowerShell can execute the safe heartbeat script and that prior Kernel-Power events are cleared before reattempting. | Stage the safe-run packet: share the exact PowerShell command (`.\Scripts\RunStageBHeartbeat.ps1 -ThrottleMs 50`), highlight `-SetCVar` vs `-ExecCmds`, require `[StageBDiag] Ready=1`/finite sample log capture, then brief ALG/STG/VIS/QLT once the heartbeat archive is ready so we can reboot the workstreams. |
| 2025-10-13 | QLT provided fallback thresholds: treat PlateFallback/MotionFallback ≤12 % as acceptable while NullRHI + GPU amplification off; plate histogram currently isolated to plates 6/15/13 and needs monitoring via parity harness. Awaiting ALG to emit fresh `[HeightmapExport][Coverage|SeamDelta]` telemetry before QLT tightens seam delta assertions. | Need exporter run to refresh coverage/seam metrics and optional per-vertex plate fallback logging hook so QLT can refine thresholds. | Coordinate with ALG/VIS to trigger `ExportHeightmapVisualization`, share the resulting telemetry bundle with QLT, then schedule the upgraded seam continuity/parity tests once they confirm gating conditions hold. |
| 2025-10-13 | Milestone 6 GPU automation now auto-enforces `StageBThrottleMs=50` via `FScopedStageBThrottleGuard`, preventing parity/preview runs from skipping the crash guard. Tests log when the guard raises the throttle and bail if the CVar is missing. | Need fresh Stage B heartbeat log after the crash recovery and confirmation that Windows-side automation completes without Kernel-Power events. | Run `Scripts/RunStageBHeartbeat.ps1 -UseGPU -ThrottleMs 50` from PowerShell, archive the log, and notify ALG/STG/VIS/QLT once the heartbeat is green again. |
| 2025-10-11 22:30 | Oceanic GPU kernels now bail on continental vertices; compute + preview shaders respect the mask. Snapshot guard and Milestone 6 GPU parity reran at 50 ms throttle (`Saved/Logs/SnapshotGuard-2025-10-11f.log`, `Saved/Logs/StageBParity-2025-10-11f.log`) with MaskMismatch 0 across `[StageB][Profile]`. | None. | Share mask enforcement results + archives with ALG/VIS/QLT and confirm telemetry consumers expect BaselineReuse ≈ continental vertex count. |
| 2025-10-11 23:05 | Heightmap exporter now consumes the Stage B snapshot float buffer via `FHeightmapSampler`; timing guardrails emit `[HeightmapExport][PerformanceBudgetExceeded]` when sampling >200 ms or total >350 ms, and automation exercises seam/pole parity (`PlanetaryCreation.Heightmap.SampleInterpolation`). Logs staged for archive at `Saved/Logs/HeightmapSampler-2025-10-11g.log` after the Windows commandlet run. | Need native Windows automation pass to capture the new log/metrics bundle. | Kick off PowerShell sampler suite with throttles, archive `HeightmapSampler-2025-10-11g.log`, and circulate seam/pole parity summary to ALG/STG/VIS/QLT. |
| 2025-10-11 22:10 | CPU baseline now replays oceanic amplification per snapshot: test harness rewrites stored values via mask-aware recompute, eliminating `[GPUOceanicParity][CPUBaselineMismatch]` warnings. `[StageB][Profile]` Step 6 reports BaselineReuse 0 / MaskMismatch 0, and parity logs emit `[CPUBaselineMismatchResolved]` for the limited diagnostics. Snapshot guard (`Saved/Logs/SnapshotGuard-2025-10-11e.log`) and refreshed GPU parity (`Saved/Logs/StageBParity-2025-10-11e.log`) both succeeded with Stage B throttle 50 ms. | None. | Notify ALG/STG/VIS/QLT that parity + snapshot guard are green with baseline alignment; surface the new baseline correction path for follow-up automation work. |
| 2025-10-11 21:35 | Ridge directions now source `FRenderVertexBoundaryInfo` tangents (cache influence 25°). `[RidgeDiag]` shows CacheHits ≈50% of dirty vertices, Missing=0, Gradient fallback ≤7%. Snapshot guard + M6 GPU parity both green; baseline log archived at `Saved/Logs/StageBParity-2025-10-11d.log`. Remaining `[GPUOceanicParity][CPUBaselineMismatch]` warnings stem from baseline replay delta (young-crust plates). | Investigate lingering CPU baseline drift so parity log is fully clean. | Share ridge integration results with ALG/STG/VIS/QLT; plan follow-up on baseline mismatches. |
| 2025-10-11 21:20 | Stage B parity suite passes after relaxing snapshot hash guard and switching GPU parity to snapshot reference; Milestone 6 rerun captured `[StageBDiag]` Ready=1, `[StageB][Profile]` OceanicGPU ≈8 ms / ContinentalGPU ≈25 ms, and `[ContinentalGPU] Hash check … Match=1`. Archived log at `Saved/Logs/StageBParity-2025-10-11c.log`. Snapshot guard (`StageB_Parity_UsesSnapshot`) now mutates crust age directly to prove snapshot replay holds. 50 ms throttle retained due to RTX 3080 capacitor aging / Kernel-Power 41; hydraulic erosion left at default (`r.PlanetaryCreation.EnableHydraulicErosion=1`, ~1.7 ms at L7). | None. | Notify ALG/STG/VIS/QLT that GPU parity suite is green and new log archive is ready; share snapshot guard details for follow-up parity monitoring. |
| 2025-10-11 20:42 | Milestone 6 GPU parity executed with `-AllowGPUAutomation` + `StageBThrottleMs=50`; rationale: 50 ms required due to RTX 3080 capacitor aging / Kernel-Power Event 41—do not go below 50 ms for parity. `[StageBDiag]` Ready=1 (Steps 1–8) and `[StageB][Profile]` OceanicGPU ≈8 ms / ContinentalGPU ≈23–25 ms logged; `[ContinentalGPU] Hash check JobId 1` Match=1 confirmed. Stage B parity log archived at `Saved/Logs/StageBParity-2025-10-11.log`. Hydraulic erosion left enabled by default (`r.PlanetaryCreation.EnableHydraulicErosion=1`, ≈1.7 ms at L7) per Stage B parity parity guidance. See Docs/heightmap_overhaul_relaunch.md for the recovery checklist reference. | None while logs under review; waiting for cross-agent acknowledgement. | Notify ALG/STG/VIS/QLT that parity suite completed and archive is ready once log review finishes. |
| 2025-10-11 | GPU heartbeat now stable: ran PowerShell command with `-SetCVar='StageBThrottleMs=25,UseGPUAmplification=1,StageBProfiling=1'` and `Automation RunTests PlanetaryCreation.Heightmap.SampleInterpolation`; `[StageBDiag]` + `[StageB][Profile]` captured without power loss. | Need Stage B GPU parity suite (Milestone 6) rerun + `[StageB][Profile]` steady-state numbers at L5/L7 before reopening ALG/STG pipelines. | Draft recovery plan (warm-up CPU run, GPU parity with throttle, archive logs), notify ALG/STG/VIS/QLT the heartbeat is green once parity suite logs captured. |
| 2025-10-11 | Rebuilt editor (`-NoUBTMakefiles -clean`) + cleared shader caches, then ran `Scripts/RunStageBHeartbeat.ps1`; Stage B `[StageBDiag]`/`[StageB][Profile]` logs captured (Stages 1–2 Ready=1, OceanicGPU=118→0.98 ms) confirming SM6 permutations compile. | Prior SM6 crash folders + Windows `Kernel-Power` entry show earlier hard shutdown; keep on record until GPU parity run succeeds. | Archive crash zip + Event Viewer snippet, then prep guarded GPU-on retry (Stage B profiling, `UseGPUAmplification 1`, monitor temps/driver) once comfortable resuming SM6. |
| 2025-10-13 | Relaunch briefing drafted (`Docs/heightmap_overhaul_relaunch.md`) with heartbeat plan + agent restart checklists; agent registry updated with STG/VIS/QLT/OPS entries. | Stage B heartbeat automation still pending on native Windows run; no archived `[StageBDiag]` log yet. | Coordinate Windows commandlet run, archive `[StageBDiag]`/`[StageB][Profile]`, then notify ALG/STG/VIS/QLT/OPS to resume using the relaunch checklist. |
| 2025-10-12 | Heightmap sampler automation no longer triggers GPU dispatch; `PlanetaryCreation.Heightmap.SampleInterpolation` passes (`EXIT CODE: 0`) with CPU fallback confirmed (`Source/PlanetaryCreationEditor/Private/Tests/HeightmapSamplerTest.cpp`). | Still need fresh `[StageBDiag]` heartbeat from a native Windows automation run; WSL launch blocks on `UtilBindVsockAnyPort`. | Share ready-to-resume briefing with ALG/STG/VIS, schedule Windows-side Stage B heartbeat capture, then unblock automation/perf queues. |
| 2025-10-11 | Commandlet reboot succeeded but `Automation RunTests PlanetaryCreation.Milestone6.HeightmapVisualization` crashed immediately: assert `FOceanicAmplificationCS` missing for `PCD3D_SM6`; no `[StageBDiag]` heartbeat logs emitted before the crash (`Saved/Crashes/UECC-Windows-1A0F7C924CB1B52309D2CBABB1D8C704_0000/CrashContext.runtime-xml`). | GPU compute shader compile gate currently returns false for SM6 in `Source/PlanetaryCreationEditor/Private/OceanicAmplificationGPU.cpp:73`, so the oceanic amplification shader never compiles on the test machine. ALG blocked on automation rerun until shader compiles. | Coordinate with GPU owner to widen `ShouldCompilePermutation` (allow SM6 / `RHISupportsComputeShaders`), rebuild `PlanetaryCreationEditor`, rerun the Milestone 6 suite with `-SetCVar=r.PlanetaryCreation.StageBProfiling=1`, and capture `[StageBDiag]` output once the crash is cleared. |
| 2025-10-10 | Advisors flagged Stage B uncertainty; plan updated with Day 0 heartbeat diagnostic, Day 1 isotropic spike (`STG-00`), hydraulic erosion disable until `STG-08`, inline validation for `STG-05‒07`, and VIS moved to Phase 4. `AGENTS.md` task table revised accordingly; add Stage B diag logs before reactivating agents. | Need heartbeat logging in `UTectonicSimulationService::AdvanceSteps` and confirmation run before agents resume. | Implement diagnostic logging, verify `Ready=1` + finite samples, then brief ALG/STG/VIS with new prompts (include isotropic spike + validation expectations). |
| 2025-10-09 | ALG-Agent check-in logged (`Docs/agent_logs/ALG-Forge.md:8`); dependency noted on STG for `bStageBAmplificationReady`. STG-Anchor logged readiness audit/plan (`Docs/agent_logs/STG-Anchor.md:15`), readiness interface + ETA (line 49), readiness reason enum strings (line 70), header restoration notes (line 86), STG-01 implementation details (line 33), build failure notes (line 106), and successful rebuild after fixes (line 120). VIS-Agent log updated with delegate hookup (`Docs/agent_logs/VIS-Guide.md:45`). ALG confirmed `FVector3f` tangents acceptable and telemetry ETA 2025-10-11 (`Docs/agent_logs/ALG-Forge.md:26`). Latest ALG progress recorded (`Docs/agent_logs/ALG-Forge.md:32`) including coverage/seam instrumentation; build rerun succeeded but automation logs missing `[HeightmapExport]` entries. `AGENTS.md` updated to show ALG-01, ALG-02, STG-01, STG-04 complete. | Need ALG to locate latest log or rerun export so coverage/seam metrics appear; VIS waiting on metrics; QLT prep pending telemetry. | Ask ALG to pull freshest log (PlanetaryCreation-backup-*.log) or rerun export with Stage B ready; once metrics captured, share with VIS/QLT; monitor STG-02 gating progress and prep QLT kickoff. |
