# PlanetaryCreation GPU System Review

## Summary
The GPU preview implementation in *PlanetaryCreation* is performing extremely well. Logs indicate that GPU preview mode has cleanly taken over Stage‚ÄØB amplification, the CPU path is skipped, and all relevant compute stages are now running efficiently with LOD caching in effect.

---

## ‚úÖ Current Observations

### GPU Preview
```
[GPUPreview] GPU preview mode ENABLED (CPU amplification SKIPPED)
[LOD Cache] Using cached L7: 164224 verts, 327680 tris (cache hit)
[OceanicGPUPreview] Height texture written (2048x1024, 163842 vertices)
```
- GPU preview mode is correctly enabled and bypasses CPU amplification.
- LOD caching is functional, with stable topology reuse.
- The height texture path is producing correct data for preview rendering.

### Performance Metrics
```
Step 1 | Total 185.68 ms | StageB 0.11 ms | Erosion 6.00 ms | Sediment 14.48 ms | Dampening 23.95 ms
Step 2 | Total 199.81 ms | StageB 0.12 ms | Erosion 6.37 ms | Sediment 19.00 ms | Dampening 24.53 ms
```
- Stage‚ÄØB is effectively free (~0.1‚ÄØms).
- Major compute costs are now in **Sediment (~14‚Äì19‚ÄØms)** and **Dampening (~24‚Äì25‚ÄØms)**.
- Stable timing and consistent LOD cache hits confirm system stability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Issues & Misses

1. **Vertex count mismatch**  
   - LOD cache shows 164,224 verts, preview log reports 163,842 processed.
   - Likely causes: seam/pole omission, equirectangular raster mismatch, or masking of continental vertices.
   - Fix: reconcile counts or clarify logging terminology (e.g., ‚Äúpixels written‚Äù).

2. **Equirectangular distortion**  
   - 2048x1024 maps stretch near poles and cause seams at 180¬∞.
   - Recommendation: move to cube-sphere faces (6 textures) for uniform sampling.

3. **Normals not matching displaced geometry**  
   - Displaced surface via GPU heightmap may misalign with CPU normals.
   - Solution: compute normals in material (finite-diff) or via a GPU post-pass.

4. **Texture wrap / seam handling**  
   - Add a duplicated 1-pixel border or set `AddressMode=Clamp` to prevent MIP bleeding at 180¬∞.

## üöÄ Next Steps (Ranked by Impact)

### 1. Optimize Sediment and Dampening (Hot Path)

**CPU Phase (fastest iteration)**
- Switch to **SoA layout** and **ParallelFor**.
- Use CSR-style neighbor lists: `NeighborsIndex`, `NeighborsStart`, `NeighborsCount`.
- Two-pass pattern: compute outflows (no atomics) then gather inflows.

**GPU Phase (future optimization)**
- Port Sediment/Dampening to compute shaders using same CSR structure.
- Maintain async readback via per-job `FRenderCommandFence`.

### 2. Ridge Direction Caching
- Cache by `TopologyStamp` (LOD + plate + boundary versions).
- Rebuild only when stamp changes; refresh a thin boundary ring otherwise.
- Add test: recompute ridges after 10 steps, assert RMS angular error < 2¬∞.

### 3. Retessellation Hysteresis
- Check drift every 5 steps.
- Trigger at >45¬∞ with bad_tri_ratio >2%, lockout until <30¬∞.
- Log frequency and wall time for data-driven tuning.

### 4. Cube-Face Preview
- Convert preview to 6 PF_R16F face textures.
- Removes pole stretch, simplifies normal calc, prepares for adaptive LOD.

## üß† Code Patterns

**CSR Neighbor Storage**
```cpp
TArray<int32> NeighborsIndex;
TArray<int32> NeighborsStart;
TArray<uint8> NeighborsCount; // <= 6
```

**Two-Pass Gather Example**
```cpp
// Pass A: Outflows
ParallelFor(N, [&](int32 v){ ComputeOutflows(v); });
// Pass B: Inflows
ParallelFor(N, [&](int32 v){ GatherInflows(v); });
```

---

## üß™ Validation & Tests
- **Preview parity**: compare GPU vs CPU elevation samples (<1e-3 tolerance).
- **Continents unchanged**: assert non-oceanic vertices unchanged.
- **Timing regression**: fail test if Erosion/Sediment/Dampening >2x baseline.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Long-Term Roadmap
- Implement **render-only adaptive LOD** (CDLOD cube-sphere tiles).
- Integrate **Nanite displacement** for 1‚ÄØm surface detail.
- Combine GPU displacement preview + adaptive LOD for real-time fidelity.

## ‚úÖ Summary for Team
> GPU Preview is stable. Stage‚ÄØB cost is down to ~0.12‚ÄØms at L7 with consistent cache hits.  
> Key issues: vertex-count mismatch, equirect seams, and normal alignment.  
> Next: focus on Sediment/Dampening optimization, ridge caching, re-tess hysteresis, and cube-face preview.  
> Goal: push step time under 100‚ÄØms at L7, then progress to adaptive LOD + Nanite displacement.
