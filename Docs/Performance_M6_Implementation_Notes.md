# Milestone 6 Performance Implementation Notes

**Date:** October 2025
**Purpose:** Clarify actual performance optimizations implemented vs exploration documents

---

## What Was Actually Implemented

### ✅ Multi-Threading with ParallelFor (Supersedes SIMD)

**Decision:** Instead of manual SIMD vectorization (AVX2/NEON intrinsics), we implemented Unreal's built-in `ParallelFor` across performance-critical paths.

**Implementation Locations:**
- `SedimentTransport.cpp:82` - Multi-threaded diffusion passes (6 iterations normal, 4 when GPU preview active)
- `OceanicDampening.cpp:70` - Parallel vertex smoothing with cached adjacency weights
- `TectonicSimulationController.cpp:1256, 2004` - Parallel mesh vertex processing

**Results:**
- M5 baseline: **6.32ms** at LOD Level 3 (vs 110ms target = 17× headroom)
- M5 feature overhead: **1.49ms** (vs 14ms budgeted = 89% under budget)
- Sediment transport: 0.30ms
- Oceanic dampening: 0.32ms
- Erosion: 0.34ms

**Why ParallelFor Over SIMD:**
1. **Better scalability:** 4-16 CPU cores (8-32× parallelism) vs SIMD 2-8 lanes
2. **Platform agnostic:** No AVX2/SSE4.2/NEON conditional compilation
3. **Cache friendly:** Task-based work stealing optimizes cache utilization automatically
4. **Maintainable:** Standard Unreal pattern, no intrinsics debugging
5. **Proven results:** Achieved 17× performance headroom without complexity

### ✅ GPU Compute Shaders (Stage B Amplification)

**Decision:** Focus GPU compute efforts on Stage B amplification (the actual bottleneck at ~23ms), not thermal/velocity fields (only 0.6ms combined).

**Implementation:**
- `OceanicAmplification.usf` - Perlin 3D noise, age-based fault amplitude, ridge-perpendicular transform faults
- `ContinentalAmplification.usf` - Texture2DArray exemplar sampling, terrain classification, weighted blending
- `OceanicAmplificationPreview.usf` - Equirect PF_R16F texture for WPO material visualization
- `OceanicAmplificationGPU.cpp` - RDG integration, async readback pooling, snapshot hashing

**Results:**
- Oceanic amplification: ~14.5ms (GPU) with <0.1m CPU parity
- Continental amplification: ~8.8ms (GPU) with snapshot-backed replay
- Async readback: ~0ms blocking cost (pooled FRHIGPUBufferReadback)
- GPU parity tests: `GPUOceanicParity`, `GPUContinentalParity`, `GPUPreviewSeamMirroring`

**Why Stage B Over Thermal/Velocity:**
- Stage B: **23.3ms** (48% of M6 budget) → High-value GPU target
- Thermal/Velocity: **0.6ms** (1.2% of M6 budget) → Low ROI
- GPU transfer overhead would likely exceed savings for small fields
- CPU thermal/velocity already well-optimized

## What Was NOT Implemented (Exploration Only)

### ⏸️ SIMD Vectorization (AVX2/NEON intrinsics)

**Status:** Exploration documents exist (`simd_gpu_implementation_review.md`) but feature was NOT implemented.

**Why Deferred:**
- ParallelFor achieved performance targets (17× headroom) without SIMD complexity
- SIMD would require:
  - Platform-specific code paths (AVX2 x64, NEON ARM, SSE fallback)
  - SoA (Structure of Arrays) data layout refactor
  - Intrinsics debugging and maintenance burden
  - Determinism validation across SIMD widths
- Estimated gains (2.1ms from Voronoi + stress) not needed given current 6.32ms baseline
- Can revisit if Level 7/8 profiling reveals CPU bottlenecks

**Documents:**
- `Docs/simd_gpu_implementation_review.md` - Planning/exploration
- `Docs/planetary_creation_simd_gpu_implementation_review_oct_6_2025.md` - Planning/exploration
- These documents describe **what we considered**, not what we built

---

### ⏸️ GPU Thermal/Velocity Field Compute Shaders

**Status:** Planned in M6 Task 4.2 but deferred as low-priority.

**Why Deferred:**
- CPU implementation already fast: Thermal 0.2ms + Velocity 0.4ms = **0.6ms total**
- Represents only **1.2%** of M6 performance budget
- GPU transfer overhead (upload plate data, download fields) would likely exceed savings
- Not a bottleneck - other areas (Stage B, hydraulic erosion) have higher ROI
- Can implement if visualization-only GPU path becomes useful (no readback needed)

## M6 Actual Performance Budget (October 2025)

```
M5 Baseline (L3):               6.32 ms  ✅ (includes ParallelFor)
+ Terrane extraction/tracking:  2.00 ms  (amortized, rare events)
+ Stage B Oceanic (GPU):       14.50 ms  ✅ (compute shader)
+ Stage B Continental (GPU):    8.80 ms  ✅ (compute shader)
+ Hydraulic erosion:            8.00 ms  🔴 (planned, not implemented)
- GPU async readback:          -0.00 ms  ✅ (pooled, non-blocking)
= M6 Current Total:            39.62 ms  (target: <90ms, 56% headroom)

With hydraulic erosion:        47.62 ms  (still 53% headroom)
```

**Notes:**
- ParallelFor savings already baked into 6.32ms M5 baseline (not a separate line item)
- SIMD exploration planned -2.1ms savings not implemented (ParallelFor superseded)
- GPU thermal/velocity planned -0.45ms savings deferred (low priority)
- Stage B GPU compute is the major M6 optimization win (~23ms)

## Key Takeaways for Onboarding

1. **When you see SIMD docs:** These are exploration/planning, not implemented features
2. **Actual optimization:** Multi-threading via `ParallelFor` (simple, effective, maintainable)
3. **GPU focus:** Stage B amplification (high value), not thermal/velocity (low value)
4. **Performance status:** 6.32ms at L3 = 17× under budget, M6 on track
5. **Future work:** SIMD can be revisited if L7/8 profiling shows CPU bottlenecks
