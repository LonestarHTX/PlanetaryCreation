# Stage B Unified GPU Parity Retrospective

## tl;dr
- **Result:** `Automation RunTests PlanetaryCreation.StageB.UnifiedGPUParity` now completes with `MaxDelta = 0.003 m` and `MeanDelta = 0.0002 m`, comfortably inside the ≤0.1 m tolerance.
- **Scope:** Unified Stage B GPU compute pipeline, continental exemplar replay, readback/validation path, automation harness, and diagnostics.
- **Key fixes:** cache seeding + snapshot rebuild before GPU dispatch, deterministic readback acceptance for tests, CPU-provided sample heights in the shader, vertex-indexed buffer access, and end-to-end parity instrumentation.
- **Validation:** Milestone 3 automation suite (`Scripts/RunMilestone3Tests.ps1 -ArchiveLogs`) is green; full editor test sweep still constrained by host memory (see follow-up).

## 1. Baseline: Where We Started

| Symptom | Observation | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Oceanic parity busted | GPU baseline applied deltas twice, leaving oceanic vertices near zero | `Saved/Automation/UnifiedGPUParityMetrics.txt` (MaxΔ ≈ 6 km) |
| Continental parity unusable | GPU replay ran before exemplar caches existed; readback fell back to CPU snapshot | `LogPlanetaryCreation` `[ContinentalGPUReadback] Summary=snapshot` |
| Automation blind spots | Harness logged metrics only on failure; hard to track progress | Early revisions of `StageBUnifiedGPUParityTest` |

The first parity runs produced catastrophic deviations (MaxΔ > 6 km). We lacked tooling to isolate whether the bug lived in shader math, buffer wiring, cache state, or readback policy.

## 2. Instrumentation & Diagnostics

1. **Parity Harness Overhaul** (`Source/PlanetaryCreationEditor/Private/Tests/StageBUnifiedGPUParityTest.cpp`):
   - Captures both CPU and GPU elevations, per-vertex baseline, weights, wrapped UVs, crust age, and exemplar stats.
   - Writes metrics to four channels: automation log, main log, automation report (`AddWarning`), and `Saved/Automation/UnifiedGPUParityMetrics.txt`.
   - Auto-selects a debug continental vertex (age-jacked above the transition threshold) and records cache metadata.

2. **Service-Level Logging** (`Source/PlanetaryCreationEditor/Private/TectonicSimulationService.cpp`):
   - Added `[UnifiedGPU][PreDispatch]` + `[UnifiedGPU][Readback]` diagnostics with work counts, cache serials, and snapshot hashes.
   - Exposed `SetForceStageBGPUReplayForTests()` to bypass production hash checks during parity automation.
   - Logged exemplar sample heights streamed from CPU for the debug vertex (`ContinentalSampleHeights` buffer).

3. **Shader Debug Buffers** (`Source/PlanetaryCreationEditor/Shaders/Private/StageB_Unified_V2.usf`):
   - Dedicated `RWStructuredBuffer<float4>` for per-vertex debug output (blended height, normalized weight sum, detail term, work index).
   - Explicit instrumentation around transition-age branches to verify coverage (and prevent early-outs from swallowing debug data).

Instrumentation proved the shader received zero-valued exemplar samples and that readback rejected GPU data despite full worklists—a critical clue for the later fixes.

## 3. Key Fixes (Chronological)

1. **Oceanic Absolute Height Replay**  
   - Reworked the unified shader to write absolute amplified elevations, not deltas, eliminating the baseline double-apply.
   - Adjusted readback to restore the captured baseline only when GPU reported deltas (legacy preview path support).  
   _Files:_ `StageB_Unified_V2.usf`, `TectonicSimulationService.cpp:9250–9400`.

2. **Cache Seeding + Snapshot Rebuild**  
   - Parity test now runs a CPU-only Stage B pass to populate `ContinentalBlendCache` and rebuilds the GPU snapshot before enabling GPU amplification.
   - Transitional crust segments (age < `UnifiedParams.TransitionAge`) get forced above the threshold for the debug vertex to ensure shader execution.  
   _Files:_ `StageBUnifiedGPUParityTest.cpp:70–185`, `TectonicSimulationService.cpp:8520–8700`.

3. **Dispatch & Readback Acceptance**  
   - Added `SetForceStageBGPUReplayForTests()` gate (dev builds) that overrides hash/serial validation so parity runs always apply GPU buffers.  
   - Logged rejection reasons when validation fails outside parity mode.  
   _Files:_ `TectonicSimulationService.h:1610`, `TectonicSimulationService.cpp:9430–9715`.

4. **CPU-Fed Sample Heights**  
   - CPU now populates `ContinentalSampleHeights[VertexIndex] = (SampleA, SampleB, SampleC, TotalWeight)` before dispatch.  
   - Shader consumes this buffer directly instead of sampling exemplar textures (fixes RDG texture binding ambiguity and PF_G16 unpack).  
   _Files:_ `TectonicSimulationService.cpp:10580–10720`, `StageB_Unified_V2.usf:320–415`.

5. **Vertex vs. Work Index Bug**  
   - The root cause of the final 1.2 km delta: shader indexed `ContinentalSampleHeights` by work index, while CPU populated by vertex index.  
   - Fix: shader now reads `SampleHeightsVector = ContinentalSampleHeights[VertexIndex];` and debug outputs map work index -> vertex id for readback.  
   _Files:_ `StageB_Unified_V2.usf:341`, `TectonicSimulationService.cpp:9680`.

6. **Crust-Age Early-Out Guard**  
   - During debugging we disabled the transition-age early return for the debug vertex to ensure instrumentation fired, then reinstated the branch with CPU/ GPU parity on crust age inputs.  
   _Files:_ `StageB_Unified_V2.usf:285–305`.

7. **Automation Reliability Improvements**  
   - Parity test harness sets `-AllowGPUAutomation`, clears shader caches between runs, and asserts that GPU dispatch produces non-zero work counts.  
   - Added `Scripts/TestMetricsCapture.ps1` shim for ad-hoc parity runs with archived metrics.

## 5. Lessons Learned

- **Indexing discipline matters.** Mixing work-list indices with vertex indices silently poisoned both our shader outputs and diagnostic buffers. Always capture both and log them together.
- **Cache + snapshot parity is fragile.** GPU pipelines that rely on CPU-built caches must seed and snapshot deterministically before dispatch, or readback cannot succeed.
- **Automation needs visibility even on success.** Writing metrics to log, automation framework, warning channel, and disk kept everyone aligned while deltas shrank from kilometers to millimeters.
- **Gate relaxations belong behind explicit dev-only switches.** `SetForceStageBGPUReplayForTests()` restored parity while keeping production hash checks intact.
- **PF_G16 unpacking should be centralized.** Feeding CPU-computed heights to the shader avoided format quirks and improved determinism; longer term we should expose a shared helper for PF_G16 ↔ float conversions.

## 6. Follow-Up / Outstanding Work

1. **Automation Coverage:**  
   - `PlanetaryCreation.Milestone6.GPU.ContinentalParity` still fails when run standalone because it exercises additional topology churn. We should port the parity harness improvements (cache seeding, replay overrides) into that suite.
2. **Full Editor Test Sweep:**  
   - `Automation RunTests PlanetaryCreation` exhausts physical + virtual memory after LOD consistency passes. Needs paging-file increase or suite partitioning before we can take a clean screenshot.
3. **Logging Trim:**  
   - Current `[UnifiedGPU][Debug]` spam is dev-only but verbose. After Milestone 6 sign-off we should demote repeated logs to `UE_LOG(LogPlanetaryCreation, VeryVerbose, …)` and keep only summary lines.
4. **Performance Capture:**  
   - Nsight/Unreal Insights profiling for the unified pipeline is still pending (per Phase 1.2 charter). Capture once the remaining automation gaps close.

## 7. File Touchpoints

- `Source/PlanetaryCreationEditor/Private/TectonicSimulationService.cpp`:9250–10980  
  GPU dispatch snapshots, readback acceptance, sample-height population, parity logging.
- `Source/PlanetaryCreationEditor/Shaders/Private/StageB_Unified_V2.usf`:250–430  
  Unified compute shader (oceanic + continental paths), debug buffer writes, corrected indexing.
- `Source/PlanetaryCreationEditor/Private/Tests/StageBUnifiedGPUParityTest.cpp`:1–400  
  Automation harness, cache seeding, debug vertex policy, metric reporting.
- `Scripts/TestMetricsCapture.ps1` (added earlier in parity effort)  
  One-click parity run with archive + console feedback.

Use these anchors for future reviews or regressions—the interplay between service setup, shader expectations, and test harness is where parity lives or dies.
