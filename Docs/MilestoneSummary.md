# PlanetaryCreation Milestone Summary

This document stitches together the high-level roadmap from `Docs/PlanningAgentPlan.md` with the detailed planning docs produced for Milestones 3 and 4. Each milestone lists its purpose, primary deliverables, and references to deeper breakdowns.

---

## Milestone 0 – Pre-Production Alignment (Week 0)
- **Goal:** Establish shared understanding of the Procedural Tectonic Planets paper and project terminology.
- **Key Deliverables:** Annotated paper review, terminology glossary, feasibility memo.
- **Validation:** Kickoff review, archived Q&A.
- **Reference:** `Docs/PlanningAgentPlan.md` (Milestone 0 section).

## Milestone 1 – Tooling & Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)
- **Goal:** Stand up the editor module, UI entry point, and placeholder mesh pipeline.
- **Key Tasks:** Create `PlanetaryCreationEditor` module, toolbar panel, integration with RealtimeMesh component, automation harness skeleton.
- **Validation:** Editor builds cleanly; stepping button updates placeholder mesh; automation smoke tests run.
- **Reference:** `Docs/PlanningAgentPlan.md` (Milestone 1 section).

## Milestone 2 – Data & Simulation Core (Weeks 2–4)
- **Goal:** Implement deterministic tectonic simulation service with plate initialization, motion, and CSV export.
- **Key Tasks:** `UTectonicSimulationService` state management, deterministic tick loop, parameter UI, baseline automation tests.
- **Validation:** CSV output reviewed by simulation lead; determinism tests pass.
- **Reference:** `Docs/PlanningAgentPlan.md` (Milestone 2 section).

## Milestone 3 – Geometry Generation & RealtimeMesh Integration (Weeks 4–6)
- **Goal:** Map simulation data to a high-density render mesh with stress/elevation visualization and automation coverage.
- **Key Phases:** Icosphere scaffold, Voronoi mapping & velocity field, stress/elevation interpolation, Lloyd relaxation, boundary overlay, async mesh pipeline, performance profiling.
- **Status:** Completed (see acceptance log in Milestone 3 plan).
- **Detailed Plan:** `Docs/Milestone3_Plan.md` (phases, tasks, acceptance criteria).

## Milestone 4 – Dynamic Tectonics & Visual Fidelity (Weeks 6–13)
- **Goal:** Enable dynamic plate topology (re-tessellation, splits/merges), hotspot/rift behaviour, high-res overlays, LOD support, and expanded validation.
- **Key Phases:**
  - Phase 1: Re-tessellation design + implementation, boundary state machine, rollback safety.
  - Phase 2: Hotspots, rifts, analytic thermal coupling.
  - Phase 3: High-resolution boundary overlay, velocity vectors.
  - Phase 4: LOD design/implementation, streaming, optimization pass.
  - Phase 5: New automation, visual comparisons, docs & release notes.
- **Detailed Plan:** `Docs/Milestone4_Plan.md`.

## Milestone 5 – Validation, Optimization, Packaging (Weeks 13–15)
- **Goal:** Final QA sweep and packaging for editor release.
- **Key Tasks:** Expand automation suite, capture profiling reports, author user guide & release notes.
- **Validation:** All automation green, profiling budget met, documentation complete.
- **Reference:** `Docs/PlanningAgentPlan.md` (Milestone 5 section).

## Future Milestones (Proposed)
Milestone 5 (from the original plan) covers validation and packaging. Additional future milestones proposed during planning: 
- **Milestone 6 – Surface Evolution & Presentation:** Erosion, material polish, advanced UI tooling (deferred scope from Milestone 4).
- **Milestone 7 – Climate & Hydrosphere Coupling:** Integrate ocean/atmosphere simulations and visualizations.
- **Milestone 8 – Shipping Readiness:** Final performance optimization, release management, cinematic materials.

These future items remain conceptual until Milestone 4 completes and stakeholders re-evaluate priorities.
