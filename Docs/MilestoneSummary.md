- **Performance:** Level 3 step time 6.32 ms with full M5 stack (1.49 ms overhead vs M4), leaving ~17× headroom; projections recorded for L5 (~15 ms) and L6 (~35 ms).
- **Docs:** `Docs/Milestone5_Plan.md`, `Docs/Performance_M5.md`, playback/erosion automation write-ups.

## Milestone 6 – Stage B Amplification & Terranes *(Weeks 17–20 — In Progress)*
**Focus:** Stage B detail amplification, terrane extraction/reattachment, SIMD/GPU optimisation, and Level 7 parity.

### Progress to Date (Oct 2025)
- **GPU Preview Pipeline (Option A)** — `Docs/gpu_preview_integration_complete.md`
  - Oceanic amplification compute shader (`OceanicAmplificationPreview.usf`) writes PF_R16F equirect texture, consumed by WPO material `M_PlanetSurface_GPUDisplacement`.
  - Controller exposes `SetGPUPreviewMode`, manages persistent GPU texture, and binds elevation scale.
  - Build confirmed (`Docs/gpu_preview_build_status.md`): editor compiles in 1.49 s after clearing stale commandlet.
- **Runtime Optimisations** — `Docs/gpu_preview_optimizations.md`
  - Added `bSkipCPUAmplification` flag to avoid redundant CPU pathways when previewing on GPU.
  - Surface version increments now gated to prevent unnecessary L7 rebuilds; async tasks instrumented for Insights.
- **Stability & Diagnostics**
  - `Docs/plate_movement_debug_plan.md` drove root-cause analysis of “frozen plates” report.
  - `Docs/gpu_preview_plate_colors_fix.md` decoupled GPU heightmap displacement from vertex color overlays; new `GPUPreviewDiagnosticTest.cpp` exercises CPU vs GPU step parity.
  - `Docs/gpu_system_review.md` confirms Stage B cost ~0.1 ms at L7, highlighting sediment/dampening as new hot spots.
- **Automation** — `Docs/GPU_Test_Suite.md`
  - `PlanetaryCreation.Milestone6.GPU.OceanicParity` and `.GPU.IntegrationSmoke` green; continental parity scaffolded pending shader.
  - Full M6 suite stands at 15 tests / 12 passing with GPU preview enabled.
- **Process Fixes** — `Docs/gpu_readback_fix_plan.md` outlines commandlet-safe fence submission to unblock async readbacks in automation; implementation queued.

### Active Work
- UI toggle and console plumbing for GPU preview mode; parity automation for continental amplification.
- Async readback submission + fence handling for commandlet automation (`ProcessPendingOceanicGPUReadbacks`).
- Terrane extraction/reattachment systems per Milestone plan, leveraging mesh surgery spike.
- SIMD refactors (SoA cache, ParallelFor) per `Docs/simd_gpu_implementation_review.md` and `Docs/planetary_creation_simd_gpu_implementation_review_oct_6_2025.md`.

### Known Gaps / Next Targets
- Oceanic preview currently visualization-only; continental GPU path, normals pass, and cube-face preview remain.
- Sediment/dampening dominate frame costs (~24 ms) — next optimisation candidates.
- Table 2 parity metrics for Level 7/8 still pending; instrumentation to split subduction/collision/elevation timers scheduled post-SIMD.

## Milestone 7 – Presentation & Material Polish *(Future, Planned)*
- **Goal:** High-fidelity shading, biome-aware materials, cinematic capture pipeline.
- **Prereqs:** Builds on amplified Stage B output and terrane mechanics from Milestone 6.
- **Key Tasks:** Dynamic material layering, biome classification, screenshot/video tooling, presentation presets.

## Milestone 8 – Climate & Hydrosphere Coupling *(Future, Planned)*
- **Goal:** Couple tectonic outputs with simplified climate and hydrology.
- **Key Tasks:** Sea-level response modeling, temperature/precipitation zones, wind/precip overlays, CSV export.
- **Status:** Not started; sequenced after Milestones 6–7 once amplified terrain is stable.

## Milestone 9 – Shipping Readiness & Cinematic Polish *(Future, Planned)*
- **Goal:** Final optimisation, release packaging, console-class performance targets.
- **Key Tasks:** GPU offloads, streaming/LOD tuning, cinematic materials, tutorials, release management.
- **Status:** Not started; final stretch after climate/material systems are in place.

## From Fundamentals to Production
With Milestones 0–5 complete, the project has research-aligned simulation fundamentals, production UX, and weathering passes in place. Milestone 6 is driving Stage B amplification, terrane systems, and GPU/SIMD optimisation; subsequent milestones (7–9) build presentation polish, climate coupling, and shipping readiness on that foundation.
