# PlanetaryCreation Milestone Summary

This summary consolidates the original roadmap (`Docs/PlanningAgentPlan.md`) with the detailed execution plans for Milestones 3 and 4. It captures every milestone, phase, task status, remaining work to reach a production-ready deliverable, and the planned follow-on milestones that extend the project to full paper parity and polish.

---

- **Acceptance Status:** All acceptance criteria met; optional polish (velocity arrows, hi-res overlay) deferred to Milestone 4.
- **Deviations vs Paper:**
  - Boundary overlay uses straight segments (logged) instead of geodesic arcs.
  - Stress model capped at 100 MPa and labeled cosmetic.

## Milestone 4 – Dynamic Tectonics & Visual Fidelity *(Weeks 6–13 — In Progress)*
Detailed plan lives in `Docs/Milestone4_Plan.md`. Current status below.

### Phase 1 – Dynamic Plate Topology

- **Task 1.1: Re-tessellation Engine** *(In progress, phases 1–2 complete)* – Deterministic full rebuild validated (0.10–18.46 ms from Level 0–6), centroid reset, area/Euler checks, rollback tested, automation in place. Pending hook to refresh Voronoi/mesh buffers post rebuild.
- **Task 1.2: Plate Split & Merge (Paper Sec. 4.2–4.3)** *(Not started)* – Implement rift-driven splits and subduction merges with deterministic events.
- **Task 1.3: Boundary State Machine & CSV v3.0** *(Not started)* – Lifecycle states (Nascent/Active/Dormant), CSV columns `BoundaryState`, `StateTransitionTimeMy`, `ThermalFlux`.
- **Task 1.4: Re-tessellation Rollback Automation** *(Partial)* – Snapshot/restore proven; finalize automation fault injection.

### Phase 2 – Hotspots, Rifts, Thermal Coupling
- **Task 2.1: Hotspot Generation & Drift (Paper Sec. 4.4)** *(Not started).* Deterministic plume seeds, hotspot drift, heat impact on stress/elevation.
- **Task 2.2: Rift Propagation Model (Paper Sec. 4.2)** *(Not started).* Divergent thresholds trigger rift widening and plate split handoff.
- **Task 2.3: Thermal & Stress Coupling (Analytic)** *(Not started).* Analytic falloff `T(r)=T_max exp(-r²/σ²)` + subduction term; affects stress/elevation additively; per-vertex temperatures exported.

### Phase 3 – Visualization & UX Enhancements
- **Task 3.1: High-Resolution Boundary Overlay** *(Not started).* Trace render seams, align overlay within one vertex; modulate by boundary state/stress; optional downsampling.
- **Task 3.2: Velocity Vector Field (Deferred from M3)** *(Not started).* Centroid arrows, magnitude scaling, UI toggle, screenshot validation.
- **Task 3.3:** Material/lighting polish deferred to later milestone per scope alignment.

### Phase 4 – LOD & Performance
- **Task 4.0: LOD Architecture Spike** *(Not started).* Evaluate RealtimeMesh LOD support; produce `Docs/Milestone4_LODDesign.md`.
- **Task 4.1: Multi-Tier LOD System** *(Not started).* Distance-based selection, hysteresis, buffer reuse.
- **Task 4.2: Streaming & Caching** *(Not started).* Async loading of cached meshes/material params.
- **Task 4.3: Profiling & Optimization** *(Not started).* Unreal Insights after M4 features; target Level 3 <120 ms (stretch <100 ms); document results in `Docs/Performance_M4.md`.

### Phase 5 – Validation & Documentation
- **Task 5.1: Expanded Automation Suite** *(Not started).* Tests for retess, split/merge, lifecycle states, hotspots, thermal coupling, LOD, rollback.
- **Task 5.2: Visual Comparison & Paper Parity** *(Not started).* Recreate paper figures; log deviations with sign-off.

### Current Summary for Milestone 4
- Fundamental retess infrastructure delivered and validated; render refresh hook pending.
- Remaining work: implement plate split/merge, hotspot/rift/thermal systems, high-res overlay, velocity vectors, LOD pipeline, performance pass, full automation/documentation.
- All simplifications/deviations are recorded in plan docs.

## Milestone 5 – Validation, Optimization, Packaging *(Weeks 13–15 — Planned)*
- **Goal:** Move from research-aligned prototype to production-ready editor deliverable.
- **Planned Deliverables:**
  - Expanded automation (determinism, mesh integrity, UI regression, new M4 features).
  - Final performance profiling reports (CPU/GPU/memory budgets) with Unreal Insights.
  - User guide, release notes, risk/validation checklist formalized.
- **Dependencies:** Completion of Milestone 4 phases.

## Milestone 6 – Surface Evolution & Presentation *(Future, Planned)*
- **Goal:** Layer erosion, sediment transport, and visual polish onto Milestone 4 systems.
- **Proposed Tasks:**
  - Implement erosion/sediment passes tied to stress/elevation history.
  - Restore deferred material/lighting enhancements (oceanic vs continental crust, volcanic emissive, day/night lighting).
  - Extend UI tooling with timeline scrubber, snapshot browser, and analytics overlays.
- **Status:** Not started; to be scheduled after Milestone 5. Documented so the erosion/polish scope is explicit.

## Milestone 7 – Climate & Hydrosphere Coupling *(Future, Planned)*
- **Goal:** Integrate simplified ocean and atmosphere interactions driven by tectonic activity.
- **Proposed Tasks:**
  - Model sea-level response to plate uplift/subduction.
  - Introduce climate zones (temperature, precipitation) influenced by thermal field and topography.
  - Visualize wind/precipitation vectors and couple to CSV/export analytics.
- **Status:** Not started; requires Milestones 4–6 completion and stakeholder prioritization.

## Milestone 8 – Shipping Readiness & Cinematic Polish *(Future, Planned)*
- **Goal:** Finalize the tool for public release or internal deployment with cinematic quality.
- **Proposed Tasks:**
  - Final optimization pass (GPU offloads, streaming, LOD tuning) targeting console-class hardware budgets.
  - Implement cinematic materials, screenshot/video tooling, and release packaging.
  - Update documentation, tutorials, and release management artifacts.
- **Status:** Not started; positioned as the final stretch after all core simulation/visual systems are in place.

## From Fundamentals to Production
With Milestones 0–3 complete and Milestone 4 underway, the research-aligned fundamentals (deterministic simulation, high-density mesh visualization, retess infrastructure) are proven. To reach a production-level tool:
1. **Finish Milestone 4:** Deliver dynamic tectonic behaviour, high-resolution overlays, LOD/streaming, and expanded validation/documentation.
2. **Execute Milestone 5:** Formal QA pass, profiling, and packaging.
3. **Plan Subsequent Milestones (6–8):** Tackle erosion/polish, climate/hydrosphere coupling, and shipping/cinematic work once core deliverables ship.

All milestones—completed, in-progress, and future—are now documented here so nothing sits “out of scope.”
