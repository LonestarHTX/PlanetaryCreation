## From Fundamentals to Production
With Milestones 0–4 complete, the research-aligned fundamentals (deterministic simulation, high-density mesh visualization, dynamic topology, LOD streaming) are proven. To reach a production-level tool:
1. **Execute Milestone 5:** Formal QA pass, profiling, orbital camera, undo/redo UI, continuous playback, and packaging.
2. **Deliver Milestone 6:** Stage B amplification, erosion/sediment, terrane handling, SIMD/GPU optimisation, Level 7 parity metrics.
3. **Follow with Milestones 7–9:** Presentation polish, climate/hydrosphere coupling, and shipping/cinematic readiness.

All milestones—completed, in-progress, and future—are now documented here so nothing sits “out of scope.”
