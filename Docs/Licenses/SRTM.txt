This Project's Use
------------------
SRTM data is used in this project for Stage B continental terrain amplification:
- 24 exemplar patches (512Ã—512 pixels each) representing young, active, and ancient orogeny
- Data preprocessed and stored in Content/PlanetaryCreation/Exemplars/
- Used procedurally at runtime for terrain synthesis (not redistributed as raw data)
