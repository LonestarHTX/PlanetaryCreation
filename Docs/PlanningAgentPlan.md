# Procedural Tectonic Plan – Editor Tool Implementation

## Mission Overview
- Deliver an editor-only Unreal Engine 5.5.4 tool that reproduces the Procedural Tectonic Planets paper using `RealtimeMeshComponent`.
- Focus on deterministic simulation, high-fidelity mesh visualization, and researcher-friendly UX without relying on PIE.
- Coordinate multidisciplinary roles (Simulation, Rendering, Tools, QA) with clear deliverables and validation gates.

## Milestone Timeline

### Milestone 0 – Pre-Production Alignment (Week 0)
- **Owner:** Technical Art Director
- **Deliverables:** Annotated paper review, shared terminology glossary, feasibility memo.
- **Dependencies:** `ProceduralTectonicPlanetsPaper` images, `RealtimeMeshComponent_HowTo.md`.

### Milestone 5 – Validation, Optimization, Packaging (Weeks 7–8)
- **Owners:** QA Lead, Performance Engineer
- **Tasks:**
  - Expand automation suite for determinism, mesh integrity, UI regression.

  - Implement continuous playback controls (Play/Pause, step rate selector) that respect determinism & rollback history.
  - Author user guide and release notes in `Docs/`.
- **Dependencies:** Automation framework, profiling tools, AGENTS.md workflow.
- **Risks:** Hardware variability; lock seeds and tolerances.

- **Tasks:**
  - Implement Stage B terrain amplification (procedural noise + exemplar blending at ~100 m scale).
  - Add terrane extraction/reattachment and localized uplift during continental collisions.
  - Implement continental erosion & sediment transport tied to stress/elevation history.
  - Apply SIMD optimizations to stress interpolation/boundary loops and prototype GPU compute for thermal/stress fields.
  - Update automation/CSV exports to include new amplification metrics; reproduce paper figures at Level 7 for parity.
- **Dependencies:** Milestone 5 data exports, exemplar datasets *(✅ Stage B SRTM catalog & cutter ready)*, profiling harness.
- **Risks:** Amplification instability, GPU integration complexity; mitigate with staged rollouts and regression tests.

  - Implement cinematic materials, screenshot/video tooling, release packaging, documentation.
- **Dependencies:** All prior milestones, marketing assets.
- **Risks:** Scope creep; lock feature set.
- **Validation:** Final QA sign-off, release checklist, documentation handoff.

## Cross-Cutting Workstreams
- Weekly integration sync between Simulation and Rendering leads to track data contracts.
- Maintain a risk register highlighting RealtimeMesh API gaps or math uncertainties.
- Track migration plan for the `StructUtils` plugin dependency (RealtimeMeshComponent) now flagged for removal in UE 5.5+, and secure replacement before engine upgrade.
- Document deviations from the paper in `ProceduralTectonicPlanetsPaper/README_addendum` (create if needed).
- Ensure plugin updates mirror source control and CI builds the editor target.

## Validation Summary
- **Profiling:** Use `stat unit`, `stat RHI`, and Unreal Insights at each milestone.
- **Automation:** Run editor automation suites (`UnrealEditor.exe PlanetaryCreation.uproject -run=Automation -Test=PlanetaryCreation`).
- **Visualization:** Capture comparison screenshots versus paper figures for elevation, stress, and temperature maps.
- **Sign-off:** Require Simulation + Rendering lead approval per milestone before moving forward.
