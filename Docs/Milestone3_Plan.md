# Milestone 3: Geometry Generation & RealtimeMesh Integration

## Overview
Turn the deterministic M2 simulation into a believable planetary surface with high-density geometry, proper topology, and scalar field visualization.

## Goals (Refined from Code Review)
1. Replace debug triangles with production **icosphere scaffold** (quad-sphere deferred)
2. Map simulation fields (plate IDs, velocities, stress, elevation) to render mesh
3. Implement Lloyd relaxation and **simple boundary rendering** (no full Voronoi arcs)
4. Add visualization overlays (boundaries, velocity vectors, debug layers)
5. Ensure interactive performance with **scoped async mesh updates** (mesh build only, not simulation)

## Scope Constraints
- **In Scope:** High-density icosphere (levels 0-4), plate-to-surface sampling with KD-tree, Lloyd relaxation (8 iterations), simplified stress accumulation, elevation visualization (flat + displaced modes)
- **Out of Scope:** Quad-sphere topology, LOD tiers, full heat diffusion PDE, geodesic Voronoi arcs, dynamic re-tessellation (full implementation), photo-realistic materials
- **Deferred to M4:** LOD system, quad-sphere option, full heat diffusion, dynamic re-tessellation implementation, timeline scrubbing, snapshot archive

## Plate Count Configuration
- **Baseline (Default):** 20 plates (`SubdivisionLevel = 0`) aligns with paper guidance and Earth's ~7-15 major/minor plates
- **Experimental Modes:** 80 plates (level 1), 320 plates (level 2), 1280 plates (level 3) available for high-resolution exploration
- **Note:** The baseline 20-plate configuration matches Milestone 2's target of "~12-20 plates" and the paper's low plate-count approach for tractable boundary reasoning
- **Separation of Concerns:** Plate subdivision (`SubdivisionLevel`) is independent from render mesh density (`RenderSubdivisionLevel`), allowing low plate counts with high-quality visualization

## Key Changes from Initial Plan (Post-Review)
- ✅ **Dropped Task 1.2 (Quad-sphere):** Icosphere-only for M3, aligns with paper
- ✅ **Dropped Task 1.3 (LOD):** Premature optimization, 5K triangles runs fine without LOD
- ✅ **Event-driven Voronoi mapping (Task 2.1):** Only recompute after regenerate/Lloyd, not every step
- ✅ **Simplified boundary rendering (Task 3.2):** Use adjacency map, not expensive geodesic arcs
- ✅ **Scoped async updates (Task 4.3):** Mesh build only, snapshot pattern to avoid race conditions
- ✅ **Capped stress model (Task 2.3):** Max 100 MPa, exponential smoothing, clearly labeled as cosmetic
- ✅ **Parameterized test suite (Task 5.1):** Default level 0 (fast), optional level 2 for geometry validation

**Estimated Impact:** ~25% time reduction, tighter scope, clearer deliverables

## Phase 1: High-Density Geometry Scaffold

### Task 1.1: Implement Icosphere Subdivision Levels
**Owner:** Rendering Engineer
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Description:**
- Extend `SubdivideIcosphere()` to support subdivision levels 0-4
  - Level 0: 20 faces (current M2 baseline)
  - Level 1: 80 faces
  - Level 2: 320 faces
  - Level 3: 1,280 faces (M3 target)
  - Level 4: 5,120 faces (stretch goal)
- Add **two independent parameters** to `FTectonicSimulationParameters`:
  - `SubdivisionLevel` (0-3): Controls plate count (20/80/320/1280 plates). Default: 0 (20 plates, paper baseline)
  - `RenderSubdivisionLevel` (0-6): Controls render mesh density, independent of plate count. Default: 0
- Keep simulation plate count independent from render mesh density
- Generate render-only vertex pool and face indices (separate from simulation `SharedVertices`)
- Validate topology with Euler characteristic test (V - E + F = 2)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can set render subdivision level in UI (0-4)
- Mesh displays correct face count at each level
- Performance ≤100ms per step at level 3 (1,280 faces)
- Automation test validates topology correctness (Euler characteristic)

**Decision:** Icosphere-only for M3. Quad-sphere deferred to M4+ (logged as future enhancement).
**Decision:** LOD tiers deferred to M4. At 5K triangles (level 4), no LOD needed for editor performance.

---

## Phase 2: Plate-to-Surface Mapping

### Task 2.1: Voronoi Cell Assignment (Render Vertex → Simulation Plate)
**Owner:** Simulation Engineer
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Description:**
- For each render mesh vertex, find closest simulation plate centroid
- Store plate ID per vertex in `TArray<int32> VertexPlateAssignments`
- Use KD-tree of plate centroids for O(log N) lookup (20 plates = ~4-5 checks per vertex)
- **Event-driven recomputation:** Only rebuild mapping when:
  1. User clicks "Regenerate" (new seed)
  2. Lloyd relaxation completes (plates redistributed)
  3. Optional: Manual "Refresh Mapping" button for debugging
- Add hysteresis to prevent flicker: only reassign if new plate is >5° closer than current plate
- Handle edge cases: vertices equidistant from multiple plates (keep current assignment within threshold)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Render mesh vertices correctly colored by owning plate ID
- Boundary vertices stable (no single-frame flicker)
- Lookup performance <1ms for 5,120 vertices (level 4) using KD-tree
- Automation test validates all vertices assigned to valid plates
- Mapping persists across steps (not recomputed every step)

---

### Task 2.2: Plate Velocity Field Sampling
**Owner:** Simulation Engineer
**Effort:** 1-2 days
**Description:**
- Compute per-vertex velocity: `v = ω × r` where ω = plate's angular velocity vector
- Store in vertex color or separate channel for visualization
- Add debug overlay to render velocity as vertex colors (magnitude → hue)
- Optionally: render velocity vectors as line primitives at plate centroids

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Velocity field visible as color gradient across plates
- Divergent boundaries show red (high velocity), convergent show blue
- Debug toggle in UI to show/hide velocity overlay

---

### Task 2.3: Stress Field Accumulation (Simplified Model)
**Owner:** Simulation Engineer
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Description:**
- Implement **simplified cosmetic stress model** at boundaries (NOT full heat diffusion PDE):
  - Convergent boundaries: stress += relativeVelocity × deltaTime (accumulates over steps)
  - Divergent boundaries: stress decays toward zero (exponential smoothing, τ = 10 My)
  - Transform boundaries: minimal stress accumulation
- Store stress per boundary in `FPlateBoundary::AccumulatedStress` (double precision)
- **Cap stress to prevent runaway:** max 100 MPa (corresponds to ~10km elevation)
- **Exponential smoothing for elevation target:** `targetHeight = stress / compressionModulus`, approach via `height += (targetHeight - height) × 0.1` per step
- Interpolate stress to nearby render vertices (distance-based Gaussian falloff, σ = 10° angular distance)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Convergent boundaries accumulate stress up to cap (100 MPa)
- Divergent boundaries decay stress toward zero (half-life ~10 My)
- Stress accumulation deterministic across identical-seed runs
- CSV export includes per-boundary stress values
- **Clearly labeled as "cosmetic visualization" in code comments and docs**

---

### Task 2.4: Elevation/Height Field Generation
**Owner:** Rendering Engineer
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Description:**
- Displace vertex positions along normals based on smoothed stress field from Task 2.3
- Add `ElevationScale` parameter to control displacement magnitude (default: 1.0 = realistic scale)
- **Clamp elevation to ±10km** (Earth-scale realism)
- Update vertex normals after displacement using cross-product of adjacent edges
- Support two visualization modes:
  - **Flat mode:** Color vertices by stress/elevation (heatmap), no geometric displacement
  - **Displaced mode:** Geometric displacement + vertex coloring
- Add UI toggle: "Elevation Mode: Flat | Displaced"

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Mountain ranges visible at convergent boundaries after 50+ steps (displaced mode)
- Rift valleys visible at divergent boundaries (negative displacement)
- Lighting responds correctly to displaced geometry (recalculated normals)
- Toggle between flat and displaced modes without artifacts
- Elevation clamping prevents >10km spikes

---

## Phase 3: Lloyd Relaxation & Voronoi Refinement

### Task 3.1: Lloyd Relaxation Algorithm
**Owner:** Simulation Engineer
**Effort:** 3-4 days
**Description:**
- Implement Lloyd's algorithm to evenly distribute **simulation plate centroids** (NOT render vertices):
  1. Compute Voronoi cell for each plate centroid (using same closest-point logic as Task 2.1)
  2. Calculate centroid of each Voronoi cell (mass center on sphere surface)
  3. Move plate centroid toward cell centroid (weighted step, α = 0.5)
  4. Repeat for N iterations until convergence
- Add `LloydIterations` parameter (default: 8, max: 10)
- **Early termination:** Stop when max centroid delta < ε = 0.01 radians (~0.57°)
- Run Lloyd relaxation during `GenerateIcospherePlates()` after initial icosahedron placement
- Preserve determinism with seeded relaxation
- **Trigger Voronoi mapping refresh** (Task 2.1) after Lloyd completes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Plate centroids more evenly distributed than raw icosahedron
- Visual inspection shows reduced "clumping" (manual review)
- Convergence achieved in ≤8 iterations for seed 42
- Log per-iteration delta (UE_LOG Verbose level)
- Automation test validates convergence (final delta < ε)

---

### Task 3.2: Boundary Overlay Using Adjacency Map (NOT Full Voronoi Arcs)
**Owner:** Rendering Engineer
**Effort:** 1-2 days
**Description:**
- Render plate boundaries using **existing adjacency map** from M2 (30 edges for baseline 20-plate icosahedron)
- For each boundary edge (PlateA, PlateB):
  1. Find rotated midpoint between shared vertices (same as M2 classification logic)
  2. Draw two line segments: PlateA centroid → midpoint, then midpoint → PlateB centroid
  3. Color lines by boundary type (divergent=green, convergent=red, transform=yellow)
- Use `ULineBatchComponent` with persistent batching (batch ID for selective clearing)
- Add `bShowBoundaries` UI toggle
- Offset boundaries above mesh surface (+15km) to prevent z-fighting with displaced geometry

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Boundaries visible as colored line segments connecting plate centroids via boundary midpoints
- Line colors match boundary classifications
- Toggle in UI to show/hide boundaries
- No expensive geodesic arc computation (deferred to M4 if needed)
- Baseline configuration: 30 boundary edges for 20-plate icosahedron
- Experimental configuration: 120 boundary edges for 80-plate icosahedron

**Decision:** Defer true Voronoi arc extraction (geodesic curves on sphere) to M4. Use simple straight-line segments (centroid→midpoint→centroid) for M3.

---

### Task 3.3: Dynamic Re-tessellation Preparation (Stub)
**Owner:** Simulation Engineer
**Effort:** 1 day
**Description:**
- Add framework for detecting when plates have drifted far from initial positions
- Trigger condition: centroid moved >X degrees from starting position
- Add `bEnableDynamicRetessellation` flag (default: false for M3)
- Log warning when trigger condition met but re-tessellation disabled
- Full implementation deferred to M4 or beyond

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Logging correctly identifies when re-tessellation would be needed
- Framework in place for future implementation
- No impact on current simulation performance

---

## Phase 4: Visualization Polish & Performance

### Task 4.1: Boundary Overlay Rendering ✅ (Merged with Task 3.2)
**Status:** COMPLETE - Merged with Task 3.2
**Implementation:** See Task 3.2 for boundary overlay details
**Known Limitation:** Boundary overlay uses coarse simulation mesh (20-80 plates) while render mesh can be high-density (up to 81920 faces). This causes visual misalignment at high render subdivision levels. Future improvement: project boundaries onto high-density render mesh or use geodesic interpolation.

---

### Task 4.2: Velocity Vector Debug Layer
**Owner:** Rendering Engineer
**Effort:** 1-2 days
**Description:**
- Draw velocity vectors as arrows at plate centroids
- Arrow length proportional to angular velocity magnitude
- Arrow direction shows Euler pole axis × position
- Add `bShowVelocityVectors` toggle in UI

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Velocity arrows visible and point in correct directions
- Arrow scaling makes sense (not too large/small)
- Toggle in UI to show/hide vectors
- Arrows update each step

---

### Task 4.3: Async Mesh Update Pipeline (Scoped) ✅
**Owner:** Rendering Engineer
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Description:**
- Mesh vertex computation moved to async task (not simulation step)
- **Snapshot pattern implemented:** Deep-copy simulation state before async handoff:
  - `FMeshBuildSnapshot` struct captures: RenderVertices, RenderTriangles, VertexPlateAssignments, VertexVelocities, VertexStressValues, ElevationScale, visualization state
  - `CreateMeshBuildSnapshot()` performs deep copy on game thread
- Static thread-safe mesh builder: `BuildMeshFromSnapshot()` runs on background thread
- StreamSet applied to RealtimeMesh on game thread via nested `AsyncTask()`
- Service can continue stepping while mesh builds (atomic flag prevents double-build)
- **Threshold check:** Subdivision level ≤2 uses synchronous path, level 3+ uses async (not based on time)

**Implementation Details:**
```cpp
// TectonicSimulationController.h
struct FMeshBuildSnapshot { /* render state */ };
std::atomic<bool> bAsyncMeshBuildInProgress{false};
double LastMeshBuildTimeMs = 0.0;

// TectonicSimulationController.cpp
if (RenderLevel <= 2) {
    // Synchronous: snapshot → build → update (fast path)
} else {
    // Async: snapshot → background build → game thread update
    AsyncTask(BackgroundThread, [snapshot]() {
        BuildMeshFromSnapshot(snapshot, streamSet, ...);
        AsyncTask(GameThread, [streamSet]() {
            UpdatePreviewMesh(streamSet, ...);
        });
    });
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Mesh updates don't block main thread at subdivision level 3+
- ✅ No crashes or artifacts from threading (clean build, snapshot pattern prevents race conditions)
- ✅ Simulation can step while mesh rebuilds in background (atomic flag guards re-entry)
- ✅ Async only triggers at level 3+ (level 0-2 use synchronous path)
- 🔲 `stat unit` validation deferred to manual testing (Task 4.4)

**Decision:** Async mesh build ONLY. Simulation step remains single-threaded for M3 (clearer correctness).

**Description:**
- Add tests for new M3 features:
  - Subdivision topology correctness (Euler characteristic: V - E + F = 2)
  - Voronoi assignment coverage (all vertices assigned to valid plates)
  - Lloyd relaxation convergence (max delta < ε after ≤10 iterations)

---

## Decisions Made (From Code Review)

1. **✅ Scaffold Choice:** Icosphere-only for M3. Quad-sphere deferred to M4+ (logged as future enhancement). Aligns with paper, reduces scope.

2. **✅ LOD System:** Deferred to M4. At 5K triangles (level 4), no LOD needed for editor performance. Premature optimization.

3. **✅ Stress Model:** Simplified boundary-driven accumulation with exponential smoothing and capping. Full heat diffusion PDE deferred to M4+. Clearly labeled as "cosmetic visualization."

4. **✅ Lloyd Iterations:** Cap at 8 (default), max 10. Early termination when delta < 0.01 radians (~0.57°). Deterministic with seeded relaxation.

5. **✅ Performance Target:** Level 3 (1,280 faces) required, ≤100ms per step. Level 4 (5,120 faces) stretch goal. Interactive stepping is priority.

6. **✅ Dynamic Re-tessellation:** Framework/stub only in M3. Log warnings when drift exceeds threshold, but defer full rebuild logic to M4+.

7. **✅ Voronoi Mapping:** Event-driven recomputation (after regenerate or Lloyd), NOT every step. Use KD-tree for O(log N) lookup. Add hysteresis (5° threshold) to prevent flicker.

8. **✅ Boundary Rendering:** Use existing adjacency map with simple line segments, NOT full geodesic Voronoi arcs. Defer expensive arc computation to M4 if needed.

9. **✅ Async Mesh Updates:** Scope to mesh build only (not simulation step). Snapshot state before async handoff. Skip async for small meshes (<50ms build time). Simulation remains single-threaded for M3.

---

## Estimated Timeline (Revised After Scope Refinement)

- **Phase 1:** 2-3 days (icosphere subdivision only, no LOD)
- **Phase 2:** 7-9 days (Voronoi mapping + velocity + stress + elevation)
- **Phase 3:** 4-5 days (Lloyd relaxation + simple boundary rendering)
- **Phase 4:** 5-7 days (visualization overlays + async mesh + profiling)
- **Phase 5:** 3-5 days (validation + visual comparison + docs)

**Total:** 21-29 days (~4-6 weeks with 1 engineer, 2.5-3.5 weeks with 2 parallel tracks)

**Scope Reduction from Original Plan:**
- Dropped: Quad-sphere (Task 1.2)
- Dropped: LOD tiers (Task 1.3)
- Simplified: Boundary rendering uses adjacency map, not full Voronoi arcs
- Scoped: Async updates to mesh build only (not simulation step)
- ~25% time savings from eliminating optional features
