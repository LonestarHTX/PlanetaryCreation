# PlanetaryCreation – Session Log (2025-10-06)

## Work Completed
- Updated `ContinentalAmplification.usf` to define `PI`, clamp exemplar layer access, and fetch samples via `Texture2DArray.Load` with integer coords.
- Instrumented continental GPU readback to report override counts and surface CPU⇔GPU diffs; augmented Milestone 6 parity automation to log representative mismatches.
- Rebuilt `PlanetaryCreationEditor` after each change and reran `Automation RunTests PlanetaryCreation.Milestone6.GPU` multiple times.

## Current Test Status
- Passing: `Milestone6.GPU.IntegrationSmoke`, `.PreviewDiagnostic`, `.PreviewVertexParity`.
- Failing: `.ContinentalParity` (≈3.1% within tolerance; max delta ~432 m) and `.OceanicParity` (93.43% parity; max delta ~203 m).
- Latest logs under `Saved/Logs/PlanetaryCreation.log` include `ContinentalGPUReadback` / `ContinentalGPUInputs` diagnostics and sampled CPU/GPU mismatches (`Vertex 2, 9, 22, 25, 26`).

## Next Steps
1. Use the new logging and ridge-direction cache verification to reconcile CPU vs GPU continental amplification (exemplar indices/weights, baseline usage).
2. Investigate persistent oceanic parity regression (ridge direction alignment, transform-fault noise) and keep the GPU suite green.
3. Consolidate performance capture into the Unreal Insights + CSV harness, refresh shared tables, and record subduction/collision/elevation timers for Stage B.
4. Raise the default retessellation threshold to 45° with a High Accuracy (30°) toggle and normalize sediment/dampening adjacency caching before the next perf run.
5. Keep treating Level 7 as a validation tier until async GPU amplification lands; scope the readback/fence plan for Milestone 7.
6. After the fixes above, rerun `powershell.exe … Automation RunTests PlanetaryCreation.Milestone6.GPU; Quit` to confirm all five tests pass.
7. Reference `Docs/Performance_M6.md` for the unified Stage B + L3 harness; point other reports at that single source when updating metrics.

## PRO Review Follow-up (2025-10-07)
- Performance figures in docs conflict (L3 ≈ 101 ms vs 6.32 ms); adopt a single capture harness and republish consistent numbers.
- GPU preview remains oceanic-only; continental GPU path, normals pass, cube-face preview, and async readback are still pending M6/M7 tasks.
- Amplification parity: M6 suite currently 15 tests / 12 passing when preview is enabled; prioritize closing the remaining gaps before declaring M6 complete.
- Quick wins identified: ridge cache integration, higher retess threshold, adjacency caching, and async readback scheduling.
- Expectation reset: Level 7 is validation-only during M6; interactive L7 belongs to the M7 polish window once async preview is live.
