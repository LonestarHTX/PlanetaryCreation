# PlanetaryCreation – Session Log (2025-10-06)

## Work Completed
- Updated `ContinentalAmplification.usf` to define `PI`, clamp exemplar layer access, and fetch samples via `Texture2DArray.Load` with integer coords.
- Instrumented continental GPU readback to report override counts and surface CPU⇔GPU diffs; augmented Milestone 6 parity automation to log representative mismatches.
- Rebuilt `PlanetaryCreationEditor` after each change and reran `Automation RunTests PlanetaryCreation.Milestone6.GPU` multiple times.

## Current Test Status
- Passing: `Milestone6.GPU.IntegrationSmoke`, `.PreviewDiagnostic`, `.PreviewVertexParity`.
- Failing: `.ContinentalParity` (≈3.1% within tolerance; max delta ~432 m) and `.OceanicParity` (93.43% parity; max delta ~203 m).
- Latest logs under `Saved/Logs/PlanetaryCreation.log` include `ContinentalGPUReadback` / `ContinentalGPUInputs` diagnostics and sampled CPU/GPU mismatches (`Vertex 2, 9, 22, 25, 26`).

## Next Steps
1. Use the new logging to reconcile CPU vs GPU continental amplification (check exemplar indices/weights, detail scaling, baseline usage).
2. Investigate persistent oceanic parity regression (inspect ridge direction / age inputs vs shader math).
3. After fixes, rerun `powershell.exe … Automation RunTests PlanetaryCreation.Milestone6.GPU; Quit` to confirm all five tests pass.
